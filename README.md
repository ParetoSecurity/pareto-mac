## Peace of Mind

The simplest security is the most important. 80% of hacks are caused by 20% of common preventable mistakes. Pareto Security is a Menu Bar app that quietly runs in the background and prevents security facepalms, so you can focus on more important things in life.

- You **forgot to enable FileVault** disk encryption, then lost your MacBook and now a stranger has all your photos and documents?
- You needed to **turn off Gatekeeper** to be able to install an app you found on the Internet, then failed to turn it back on again and got malware?
- You **turned off firewall** to debug a router, then did not remember to turn it on and accidentally exposed your local webserver to the entire Starbucks or hotel network?
- You **procrastinated on updating your apps** for a long time and got hacked because you were not running a more recent version with the security patch already applied?
- You lent your Mac Mini to your mom for a weekend, then forgot you enabled **automatic login** for her convenience?
- You used your MacBook for a presentation, temporarily disabled **automatic screen locking**, did not re-enable it, then left it running in your office the next day only to find your coworkers having fun with your Facebook account when coming back from lunch?

All of the above are easily preventable. The Pareto Security app regularly checks such common security fails, and reminds you to take care of them.
