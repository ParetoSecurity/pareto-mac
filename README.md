## How Pareto Security keeps you secure

- Chris **forgot to enable FileVault** disk encryption after OS reinstall, then someone stole his MacBook, and now they have all of his photos, documents, and business files.
- Suzie **turned off the Firewall** to debug a router, did not remember to turn it back on, and accidentally exposed her local webserver to the entire Starbucks network.
- James lent his MacBook to mom for a weekend, forgot he enabled **automatic login** for her convenience, then found his son playing on his company's Slack.
- Paul needed to **turn off Gatekeeper** to install an app he found on the Internet, then failed to turn it back on again, and his Mac got infected with malware.
- Marie did not set **auto-updating of apps** and got hacked because she was not running a recent app version with the security patch applied.
- Mia used her MacBook for a presentation, disabled **automatic screen locking**, forgot to re-enable it, only to find coworkers having fun with her Facebook.

All of the above are easily preventable. The Pareto Security app regularly checks such common security fails and reminds you to take care of them.
